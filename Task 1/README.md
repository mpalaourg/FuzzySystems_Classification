# Fuzzy Systems 4th Assignment, AUTh [2019]
> Create a fuzzy TSK model to classify samples of multivariable, nonlinear functions.

> Dataset used	-> [Avila Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Avila)

> MATLAB Toolbox needed -> Fuzzy Logic Toolbox

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Fuzzy Systems" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2019.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The goal is to find the best model parameters to classify the samples of the Avila dataset. To this end 5 models were initialized by genifs2 and tested, where:
<ul>
  <li>Task Model 1 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 1.00) => NumberOfRules = 4. </li>
  <li>Task Model 2 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.80) => NumberOfRules = 5. </li>
  <li>Task Model 3 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.71) => NumberOfRules = 7. </li>
  <li>Task Model 4 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.60) => NumberOfRules = 9. </li>
  <li>Task Model 5 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.40) => NumberOfRules = 11. </li>
</ul>

## Status

As of the completion of the project, it will NOT be maintained. By no means should it ever be considered stable or safe to use, as it may contain incomplete parts, critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.
